            Hola!
            Myself Sandra from LBSITW.This is the blog I created as a part of Upskill2.0 
            event by  to learn about web development.I found this an amazing and useful 
            event by Tinkerhub LBSITW.We formed into a team as our wish and they provided 
            us a mentor to learn some basic on designing a wesite.With the driving force
            of our mentor and my teamates I was able to design this website.We were given 
            some small tasks after each session .Yeah , I enjoyed the pleasure of changing 
            a blured idea of mine into a canvas of fonts, different styles and colors 
            combinations.
